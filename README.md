The Murious App utilizes Firebase for handling the database. Firebase provides real-time data synchronization and authentication services, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Setting up Firebase:

1. **Create a Firebase project:**
   - Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on "Add Project" and follow the setup instructions.

2. **Get Firebase configuration:**
   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to Project settings.
   - Under the "General" tab, find the "Your apps" section.
   - Copy the Firebase configuration object.

3. **Configure the app with Firebase:**
   - Open the `lib/config/firebase_config.dart` file.
   - Paste the Firebase configuration object.

4. **Add Firebase dependencies:**
   - Open the `pubspec.yaml` file.
   - Remove the following Firebase dependencies:

   - Run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to remove these dependencies.

Now, your Murious App is configured to use Firebase for real-time data synchronization and authentication services. Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the Firebase configuration object with the actual values from your Firebase project.
